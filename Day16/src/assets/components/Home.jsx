    <h2>1. Introduction to React Router: Write a short explanation of what React 
Router is and why it's used. </h2>
<p>React Router is a standard library for routing in React applications. It enables the navigation between different components (or "pages") without reloading the entire page. This makes the user experience smoother and more like a traditional desktop application.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Why it's used:</strong>
<br/><br/>
Single Page Application (SPA) Support: React Router helps create SPAs where navigation feels fast and seamless.

Dynamic Routing: It allows routes to be defined dynamically based on app state or user input.

Component-Based Navigation: Routes are treated as components, making them easy to manage and integrate with the React component hierarchy.

URL Management: It keeps the UI in sync with the browser's URL, making deep linking and browser navigation (back/forward) possible.

In short, React Router makes it easy to build scalable and user-friendly navigation in React apps.</p>
